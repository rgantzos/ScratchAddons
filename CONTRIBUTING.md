# Contributing guidelines

For anyone who knows JavaScript basics: feel free to contribute to this repository! Our code is open source. Be sure to follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Filing [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues)

Found a bug? Report it in an issue! But first, be sure to check if it was already reported by using the search bar [here](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/issues). If there are no similar issues, you can create a new one. We will take a look at it.

Also, feel free to ask questions, suggest new features, and more.

Another way to suggest an idea or to ask a question is to start a [discussion](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/discussions).

## Creating [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

Contributions are welcome! If you know how to fix an issue, you can create a pull request with the necessary changes that we can then add to Scratch Addons.

If you're making a new addon, our [FAQ page](https://scratchaddons.com/docs/develop/getting-started/creating-an-addon/) will teach you how to make one.

1. **If you have something in mind, want to report a bug, or anything else, it's best if you create or find an issue first (see above). That way, we can discuss it before you start a pull request.**
2. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository if you haven't already.
3. If you already have a fork, make sure to [sync its `master` branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) to ensure your fork of Scratch Addons is up to date with ours.
4. [Clone Scratch Addons](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) so you can make and test your changes.
5. [Create a new branch](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/main/README.md#create-a-branch) from the `master` branch.
6. [Create, commit, and push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-and-pushing-changes) the changes you want to make. Make sure you're committing to your new branch.
7. Go to the website and enable workflows in Actions on your fork so we can automatically clean up your code if necessary.
8. Finally, [create a pull request](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/compare) on the origin repository (ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons). We will review your changes and talk about any further improvements if necessary.

If you don't want to use Git, [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git#using-git) mentions other ways to make changes, too.
